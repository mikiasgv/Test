                Before you receive our instant offer, you will need to fill out a questionnaire about your car’s necessary details. This information involves the
make, model, and year of your car. Next, we will ask you to tell us the zip code in which the vehicle is located to make the pickup process easier.
Lastly, we will request you to tell us in detail about your vehicle’s condition; are there any problems with your car? Is it operable? Are there any
external or internal damages?

                Don't worry about this because we purchase cars no matter what condition they are in. So, even if your car is completely wrecked or inoperable,
we urge you to answer the questions honestly to avoid conflicts during the time of pickup. We're here to help you, so just be honest and clear
with the details and leave the rest to us!

                If you are interested in the offer we have provided you with, simply go ahead and click on “Accept Offer” to move forward with the selling process.
At this point, we would require some additional information, such as the name(s) and contact number(s) of the owner(s), a suitable location for
pickup, and in some cases, photo evidence regarding the condition and ownership of the vehicle. After all the required information is secured, the
pickup request is forwarded to our local handlers.

                Our handlers manage their pickup schedules themselves. Hence, no certain day or time can be specified, but our handlers are very flexible and
                cooperative with the vehicle pickups. They will get in touch with you to come up with a pickup place and time according to your convenience.

                As our handlers arrive at the specified location for pickup, they will conduct a quick inspection of the vehicle to ensure that everything is
according to what was stated. If everything seems in place, they will hand over a check to you for your keys, titles (if applicable), and your car. All
that remains is for our handlers to tow the car away - it doesn’t get easier than that!

                If you still have doubts then, all of our handlers are certified and vetted to ensure legitimacy. Our process is safer and more comfortable than
selling your car to a stranger who you’ve found over the internet.

                      This question is a little tricky to answer as it depends on a few different things, such as the state you are located in, the year of your car, and what
other documentation you have available to show ownership of the car. It is allowed to buy cars without a title in some states, but you would still
be required to show a photo ID that matches the registration as proof of ownership. Due to legal circumstances, we are unable to purchase
abandoned vehicles under any condition. We are also not liable for impound fees if your car has to be released.

                      We understand that efficiency is essential to you, and you cannot wait to get rid of your old, rusty car. This is why we have been working with
some of the best junk car handlers in your area to ensure quick and easy removal. As soon as all the documentation has been secured, we
forward the details to our local handler who will contact you to schedule a time and date of extraction. As all of our extractions are handled by
local carriers, <strong>WE CANNOT ENSURE A CERTAIN TIME AND DATE OF EXTRACTION</strong>, but most of our pickups happen within 2 working days
after the offer has been accepted.

                      None at all, you will receive the entirety of the promised sum at the time of pickup without a cent missing. We understand that there are a lot of
businesses out there that try to change the agreed-upon price at the time of pickup, which has lead to a bad reputation for our industry, but when
you sell your car to <a href="https://cashforcars.io">Cash for Cars</a>, you can be sure that the price you were offered at the time the offer was accepted is what you will be
receiving at the time of pickup, GUARANTEED!
However, we urge you to practice utmost honesty while filling out the questionnaire regarding the condition of your car, as our handlers will
inspect the car to make sure everything is sound and by the statement previously provided.

                      We calculate our offered prices based on various real-time factors such as going market rates, recent sales and auction prices, going prices for
scrap metal, distance from your location to the buyer’s, and more. Our prices include the cost incurred by towing, which is sometimes even higher
than the value of the car. As our offers are dependent on real-time market rates, we cannot lock in a specified price until an offer is accepted and
the required information is secured.
